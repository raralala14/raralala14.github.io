# Project #: Stardew Valley (Priority Queue)

* Author: Rachel Lawrence
* Class: CS321 Section 1
* Semester: Fall 2022

## Overview
In this program, a MaxHeap is used to contain Task objects, which have their own priority levels and hour numbers. Each Task is compared to another task through the MaxHeap to determine which task should be completed next based on a scheduling algorithm. These Task objects are generated, rearranged, and shuffled within MaxHeap and PriorityQueue to represent the scheduling system. 


## Reflection

This project really tested me. I most of the time had some sort of error 
in my output which was always difficult to solve, however in the end I did not 
have any null pointers and the program compiled. With lots of help from Amit, 
the tutors, and my father who is a developer himself I was able to pass 4 out 
of the 6 test cases. I found it odd that two whole test cases failed, but the 4
others passed... No one could seem to figure it out.

Although I was faced with many challenges, this project helped me to 
advance my proficiency in Java and gave me confidence. I appreciated the 
challenge and I am excited to use the knowledge I gained in future projects.

## Compiling and Using

Run the in (1,2,3,4,5,6) files through the command line to see the output.

## Results 

I was able to successfully pass 4 test cases (1, 4, 5, 6).
