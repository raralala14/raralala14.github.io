/**
 * Provides a static method generateTwinPrime(int min, int max)
 * that generates a value for the HashTable
 * table size m in the range of [min:max].
 * A good table size is a prime m that is 2 away
 * from another prime (such that m and m − 2 are primes).
 * Two primes (that differ by two) are called “twin primes.”
 * The method to generate twin primes should find the
 * smallest set of twin primes both in the given range.
 * The HashtableTest class will call generateTwinPrime(95500, 96000)
 * to get an appropriate twin prime for the experiment.
